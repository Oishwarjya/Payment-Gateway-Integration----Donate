# Description
India is known for its cultural and traditional history, hertitage and its marvelous handicrafts. From the North to South, East to West, each part of this nation has a different art form to offer.
However, due to massive industrialization and factory production of cheap goods, these age old arts and candicrafts are unable to hold up.
We at Pehchaan are dedicated to uplift and support these craftsmen by promoting their work  among the public for a bigger audience. We also conduct workshops to keep the skill alive and flourishing, so this precious art form never dies.
